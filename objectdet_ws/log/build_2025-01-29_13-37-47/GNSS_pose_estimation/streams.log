[1.214s] CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
[1.214s]   By not providing "Findcustom_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
[1.214s]   has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
[1.214s]   "custom_msgs", but CMake did not find one.
[1.214s] 
[1.215s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "custom_msgs" with

[1.215s] 
[1.215s]   Add the installation prefix of "custom_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
[1.215s]   "custom_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
[1.215s]   "custom_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
[1.215s]   has been installed.
